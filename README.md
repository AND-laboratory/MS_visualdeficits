# Visual Processing Phenotypes in MS

This exploratory study examines the relationship between cognitive and visual deficits in early MS by employing a three-system model of afferent-sensory, central-cognitive and efferent-ocular motor visual processing to identify unique visual processing phenotypes. Analyses for this paper were completed in RStudio and Mplus. 

There are 3 documents contained in this folder, as follows:

1. Mplus file with code used for LPA model with imputed data
2. Mplus file with code used for LPA model with pairwise missing data
3. R markdown file with code for all other analyses

NB: The two Mplus files contain the final models used in the paper. To change the number of profiles estimated by the model, edit the number in parentheses in the argument "classes = c()".
